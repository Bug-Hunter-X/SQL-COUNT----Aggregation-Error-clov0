```sql
-- Check for potential NULL values in the 'department' column that might affect the count.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND department IS NOT NULL;

-- If NULL values are not the issue, check the table structure and data for inconsistencies.
-- Ensure the 'department' column is correctly populated and indexed for efficient counting.
-- Verify data integrity through comparison with other related tables or data sources if necessary.
